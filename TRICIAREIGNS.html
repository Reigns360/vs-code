    <h1>LIFE OUT OF SCRATCH</h1>
    <h2>THE BORN</h2>
    <p>"It's a girl!" Said a beautiful lady in a blue dress smiling at me. It was my first day in this hostile environment.I cried helplessly till my beatiful momma put her welcoming hands on me tears all over her face with the joy of receiving a beatiful bouncing baby. little did she know that that was the last tear she was shading out of bringing angels to the world.
        The woman in blue handed me over to my life saver, my beautiful granny. She received me in grattitude like I was of her own, not knowing that one day life would hand me over to her as her own.  </p>
    <p>Amerikwai. Amerikwai is the plalce. this where everything happens. If there exists hell then amerikwai is my hell and if there exists heaven then am sure Amerikwai is my heaven. the village that brought me up to the stage I am right now. The village that showed me what life really is, the village that gave me family out of my family. It gave me friends worth to be brothers. Amerikwai was, is and will always be my home.</p> 
    <h2>THE MISTERY BEGINS</h2>
    <p>I stayed at my granny's place ever since i was born, the reason i cant tell. I have leaved with no father figure and partial mother figure. I rarely saw my mother, i wasn't even sure she was my mother because all my siblings could refer to her by her real name and so did I. i have two siblings, Whitney, our first born and Frankline, the scond born. Three years later marked the begining of misteries in my life. I used to believe that it was the making of God who I also believed was the creator of everything and everyone.</p>
